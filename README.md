Example Python application deployed on AWS Lambda with Github Actions.

## What
This example uses three reusable workflows and one workflow for PRs, one for Main branch commits, and one for releases.
 - The first workflow is triggered on a PR. It builds the application, publishes the zip to AWS S3 and updates ssm variables for the application.
 - The second workflow is triggered on a commit to the main branch. It builds the application, publishes the zip to AWS S3 and updates ssm variables for the application.
 - The third workflow is triggered on a release. It copies the application from the staging s3 bucket to the production s3 bucket and updates ssm variables for the application.

The reusable workflows are prefixed with `reusable` and are located in the `.github/workflows` directory. They assist with the following:
 - `reusable-publish-lambda-zip.yaml` - This workflow builds the application, publishes the zip to AWS S3 and updates ssm variables for the application.
 - `reusable-deploy-lambda.yaml` - This workflow deploys the application to AWS Lambda using GitOps by triggering a stack.
 - `reusable-promote-lambda-zip.yaml` - This workflow copies the application from the staging s3 bucket to the production s3 bucket and updates ssm variables for the application.

## How
There are three supporting github actions that are prefixed with `reusable`. These
break down the tasks for managing lambda applications.

All of the workflows in this repository can be used directly in your own repository with little need for modification.
The only changes that need to be made are to the `.github/config/app.yaml` file. This file contains the S3 bucket and
IAM Roles that are used by the workflows.

## Getting Started
To get started, you will need to create a new repository from this template. Then
you will need to update the `.github/config/app.yaml` to use your own
s3 bucket and ssm variables. The IAM roles used in each account (dev, staging, prod)
will all also need to be set.

The `cicd-role-arns` (IAM Role ARNs) can be created by using the `github-oidc-roles` component [found here](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/tree/main/modules/github-oidc-role) deployed with the `lambda-cicd` policy.
The `artifacts-role-arn` can also be created by the above component, it is deployed as the same account as the s3-bucket.
The s3 bucket can be created by using the `s3-bucket` component [found here](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/tree/main/modules/s3-bucket) with the following `privileged_principal_actions` policy:
```yaml
privileged_principal_actions:
  - s3:PutObject
  - s3:GetObject
  - s3:ListBucket
  - s3:GetBucketLocation
```
Similarly the bucket will need to trust the `artifacts-role-arn` in the `privileged_principal_arns` variable.
example 
```yaml
        privileged_principal_arns:
        - arn:aws:iam::01234567890:role/acme-core-gbl-artifacts-gha-iam-lambda-cicd: [""]
```
